# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project applies Data Science &amp; Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on key factors such as class, age, gender, fare, and embarkation point. The model is integrated into a PyQt5 desktop application, allowing users to input values and receive predictions interactively.
